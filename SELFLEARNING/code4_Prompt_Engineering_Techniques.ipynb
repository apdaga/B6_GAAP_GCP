        "\n",
        "**Description:** Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) is a prompting technique designed to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by explicitly prompting the model to generate a draft response, then generate verification questions for its own response, answer those questions independently of the initial draft, and finally use the answers to revise and improve the original draft. This creates a self-correction mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks requiring high factual accuracy and reduced hallucination, such as question answering, summarization of factual information, and generating reports or summaries based on provided text. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex or potentially ambiguous information where the model might otherwise confidently generate incorrect details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When factual accuracy is critical and errors could be harmful or misleading.\n",
        "- To reduce hallucinations and improve the reliability of the model's output.\n",
        "- When verifying information against external sources is not immediately feasible or desired within the prompting process itself.\n",
        "- For generating summaries or answers that require synthesizing information from multiple potential points within the model's knowledge or context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate Initial Draft:** The model first generates a direct answer or response to the original prompt.\n",
        "2. **Generate Verification Questions:** The model is then prompted to generate questions that would help verify the correctness of the statements made in the initial draft.\n",
        "3. **Answer Verification Questions:** The model answers these verification questions *independently* of the initial draft, drawing from its internal knowledge or provided context. This step is crucial as it prevents the model from simply confirming its own potential errors.\n",
        "4. **Revise Initial Draft:** The model compares the answers to the verification questions with the original draft and revises the draft to align with the verified information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This iterative process helps the model identify inconsistencies or inaccuracies in its initial output and correct them before presenting the final response.\n",

        "4.  **Revise Initial Draft (Internal, based on verified answers):** \"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air, water from the soil, and light energy from the sun.

        "**Description:** ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompting is a technique that combines reasoning trace generation with task-specific actions. It encourages the model to interleave thinking steps (Reasoning) with taking actions (Acting) through tools or interacting with an environment. The model observes the outcomes of its actions and uses this information to refine its subsequent reasoning and actions. This allows the model to perform tasks that require interacting with external sources of information or performing physical (or simulated physical) actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application Areas:** Tasks that require external knowledge lookup, interacting with APIs or tools, complex decision-making, and environments where actions have observable consequences. Examples include answering questions that require searching the web, using a calculator for complex math, interacting with a simulated game environment, or completing tasks that involve multiple external steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to Use:**\n",
        "- When the task requires up-to-date information not present in the model's training data.\n",
        "- When the task involves complex calculations or operations that the model is not inherently good at performing reliably.\n",
        "- When the task requires interacting with external systems or data sources.\n",
        "- To enable the model to break down a complex task into smaller, executable steps based on external feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works (Simulated in a Prompt):** In a prompt, ReAct is simulated by guiding the model to explicitly state its \"Thought\" process (reasoning about the next step or action) and its \"Action\" (the action it would take or the tool it would use), followed by an \"Observation\" (the simulated result of the action). The model then uses the Observation to inform its next Thought and Action.\n"
